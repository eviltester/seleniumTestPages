Selenium Test Pages
=================

Web pages to serve as test examples and practice for Selenium WebDriver

Used in the book Selenium Simplified

http://seleniumsimplified.com/about-2nd-edition/

And the Training course

http://unow.be/at/webdriverapi

These pages are no longer hosted online. Instead they have been updated and restyled as part of

https://testpages.herokuapp.com/

These pages are considered legacy, but match the code in the books.

The automated @Test code executed against these pages are run on cloud based WebDriver grids hosted by:

* [BrowserStack](http://browserstack.com)
* [SauceLabs](http://saucelabs.com)
